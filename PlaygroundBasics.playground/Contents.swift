/*
Welcome to your first Playground!

In Playgrounds, you can write code and instantly see the results. This is a fun and interactive environment to learn Swift.
You'll use it to experiment, play with code, and get instant feedback.

Let's start by exploring a few key things you should know:
- How to add comments
- How to print output to the console
- How to run code
*/

/*
Comments are notes you can add to your code to explain what it does.
They don't affect your program's behavior but are helpful for you and others who read your code.

This is a single-line comment. You can write anything here!
*/

// write anything here!

/*
In Playgrounds, we can print things to the console to see the results of our code.
Try using the `print()` function to display a message!
*/
let sum = 3 + 4
// This will show "Hello, Playground!" in the console
print("Skibidi toilet!")

/*
To see what happens when you run your code, make sure your console is visible.
If you don't see it, go to the Xcode menu bar and click:
View -> Debug Area -> Activate Console
OR click on the console in the very bottom right of playgrounds (Looks like a box with a line at the bottom)
*/

print("Skibidi toilet")

print("What is 3 + 4: \(sum)")
/*
if you press and hold on the playback button (Looks like a play arrow in the bottom left) and select "Automatically run" playgrounds will run your code automatically as you type, so you can see results instantly.
If you ever need to stop the automatic playback, you can click on the "Play" button in the bottom left.

Try writing a simple message and see it print automatically:
*/

print("This code runs as soon as you type it!")

/*
You can also experiment with simple math or text.
Try combining some text like this:
*/

print("5 times 10 is: \(10 * 5)")

/* This is called interpolation - where we can add values to text by using \() within the quotation marks notice how we did math within that interpolation
*/

// What happens when you try printing a number?
print(100)
